# UI Improvements - Simplified & Cleaner Interface

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Status Indicators - Green/Red Dots**
- **Before**: Text labels like "Connected", "Disconnected", "Idle"
- **After**: Simple green (●) or red (●) dots
- **Benefits**: 
  - Cleaner, less cluttered interface
  - Instant visual feedback
  - Green = Active/Connected
  - Red = Inactive/Disconnected

### 2. **Removed Message Notifications**
- **Before**: Floating messages appeared for every action
- **After**: Messages are hidden (display: none)
- **Benefits**:
  - Less visual noise
  - Cleaner user experience
  - Focus on the main content

### 3. **Admin Page - Camera Only**
- **Before**: Two-column layout with Admin camera + Visitor camera
- **After**: Single full-screen admin camera
- **Why**: Visitors don't broadcast, they only watch
- **Benefits**:
  - Larger camera view for admin
  - Simpler interface
  - More professional appearance

### 4. **Fixed Camera Zoom**
- **Before**: `object-fit: cover` (zoomed in, cropped)
- **After**: `object-fit: contain` (full view, no crop)
- **Benefits**:
  - Shows accurate camera position
  - No distortion
  - Better for streaming

### 5. **Larger Video Container**
- **Before**: Smaller video windows in grid layout
- **After**: Full-width video container with 16:9 aspect ratio
