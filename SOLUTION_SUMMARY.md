# 🎯 Solution Summary - Deploy to Railway

## ❌ The Problem

Your app is getting socket connection errors on Vercel because:

**Vercel doesn't support WebSocket connections.**

Vercel is a serverless platform designed for short-lived requests (< 60 seconds). Your app needs real-time bidirectional communication, which requires long-lived connections.

---

## ✅ The Solution

**Deploy to Railway instead of Vercel.**

Railway is a full-featured hosting platform that supports:
- ✅ WebSocket connections
- ✅ Long-lived connections
- ✅ Real-time communication
- ✅ Socket.io
- ✅ Your streaming chatbot

## 🎯 Why Your App Needs WebSocket

Your streaming chatbot needs:
1. **Real-time queue updates** - Admin sees visitors instantly
2. **Instant notifications** - Visitor knows when accepted
3. **Live streaming** - WebRTC signaling via WebSocket
4. **Persistent connections** - Stay connected during stream

All of these require WebSocket or long-lived connections.

---

## ✅ Local Testing (Works Perfect)

Your app works perfectly locally because your local server supports WebSocket:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open:
- Admin: http://localhost:5000/admin.html
- Visitor: http://localhost:5000/visitor.html
