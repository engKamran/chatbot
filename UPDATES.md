# Recent Updates - Admin Connection Visibility

## Overview

Updated the streaming chatbot to provide better visual feedback when the admin accepts a visitor. Now visitors can clearly see when the admin is connected and ready on camera.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (server.js)

**Added admin-ready event handler:**
- When admin accepts a visitor, the admin can now emit an 'admin-ready' signal
- This signal is relayed to the visitor through the server
- Helps coordinate the connection establishment

```javascript
socket.on('admin-ready', (data) => {
  if (activeStream && activeStream.visitorId) {
    io.to(activeStream.visitorId).emit('admin-ready', data);
    console.log('Admin ready signal sent to visitor');
  }
});
```

### 2. Admin Page (admin.html)

**Improved UI Layout:**
- Separated queue controls from video streaming interface
- Added side-by-side video layout (Admin + Visitor)
- Better visual hierarchy with clear labels
- Added remote video element to display visitor

**New Sections:**
- `queueControlsSection`: Shows next visitor and accept/reject buttons
- `videoSection`: Shows both admin and visitor video feeds side-by-side
- Sections toggle based on streaming state

### 3. Admin Client Logic (admin.js)

**Enhanced visitor-accepted handler:**
- Hides queue controls when stream starts
- Shows video section with both feeds
- Emits 'admin-ready' signal to notify visitor
- Better message feedback

**Updated endStream function:**
- Properly hides video section
- Shows queue controls again
- Ready for next visitor

**Improved remote stream handling:**
- Displays visitor video in the video section
- Properly manages video element

### 4. Visitor Page (visitor.html)

**Improved UI Layout:**
- Side-by-side video layout (You + Admin)
- Clear labels for each video feed
- Added connecting indicator overlay
- Better visual feedback

**New Elements:**
- `adminConnectingIndicator`: Shows "Connecting to Admin..." while waiting
- Disappears when admin is ready
- Emoji indicators for clarity

### 5. Visitor Client Logic (visitor.js)

**Added admin-ready event handler:**
- Hides the "Connecting to Admin..." indicator
- Shows success message
- Provides clear feedback that admin is ready

**Enhanced stream-accepted handler:**
- Better message feedback
- Shows "Connecting..." message initially
- Updates to "Connected to Admin!" when stream is ready
