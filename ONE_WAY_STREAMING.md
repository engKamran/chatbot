# 🎬 One-Way Streaming - Updated Implementation

## What Changed?

The streaming chatbot has been updated to support **one-way streaming**. Now:

- ✅ **Admin broadcasts** their video/audio to visitors
- ✅ **Visitors only receive** the admin's stream (no camera needed)
- ✅ **Visitors don't need to go live** - they just watch
- ✅ **Simpler for visitors** - no camera/microphone permissions needed
- ✅ **Better for live streaming** - like YouTube Live or Twitch

## How It Works

### Admin Side:
1. Admin opens admin page
2. Admin's camera is ON (broadcasting)
3. Admin accepts a visitor
4. Admin sends WebRTC offer to visitor
5. Visitor receives and watches the stream

### Visitor Side:
1. Visitor opens visitor page
2. Visitor joins queue (no camera needed)
3. Admin accepts visitor
4. Visitor sees "Connecting to Admin Live Stream..."
5. Visitor receives admin's video stream
6. Visitor watches the live broadcast
7. Visitor can leave stream anytime

## Visual Flow

### Admin:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Streaming with: John           │
├──────────────┬──────────────────┤
│              │                  │
│  📹 You      │  (No video)      │
│  (Admin)     │  (Receive only)  │
│  BROADCASTING│                  │
│              │                  │
│              │                  │
└──────────────┴──────────────────┘
│ [End Stream Button]             │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Visitor:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  📹 Admin Live Stream           │
│  Watch the admin's broadcast    │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│                                 │
│                                 │
│  👨‍💼 Admin Live                 │
│  (Connecting to stream...)      │
│                                 │
│                                 │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
│ [Leave Stream Button]           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Key Differences

### Before (Two-Way):
- Visitor had to enable camera
- Visitor had to enable microphone
- Visitor's video was sent to admin
- Both could see each other
- More complex setup

### After (One-Way):
- Visitor doesn't need camera
- Visitor doesn't need microphone
- Only admin's video is sent
- Visitor just watches
- Simpler setup

## Technical Implementation

### WebRTC Changes:

**Admin (Sender):**
```javascript
// Admin initializes with local media
const localStream = await webrtcManager.initialize();
// Admin creates offer and sends to visitor
webrtcManager.createOffer();
```

**Visitor (Receiver):**
```javascript
// Visitor initializes receive-only mode
await webrtcManager.initializeReceiveOnly();
// Visitor waits for admin's offer
// Visitor sends answer back
```

### New Method: `initializeReceiveOnly()`

Added to `webrtc-utils.js`:
```javascript
async initializeReceiveOnly() {
  // For receive-only mode, we don't need local media
  // Just create the peer connection for receiving
  this.peerConnection = this.createPeerConnection();
  console.log('Receive-only mode initialized');
  return null;
}
```

## Socket Events

### Admin → Visitor:
- `stream-accepted` - Visitor accepted, ready to stream
- `webrtc-offer` - Admin's WebRTC offer
- `webrtc-ice-candidate` - Admin's ICE candidates

### Visitor → Admin:
- `visitor-join` - Visitor joins queue
- `webrtc-answer` - Visitor's WebRTC answer
- `webrtc-ice-candidate` - Visitor's ICE candidates
- `stream-ended` - Visitor leaves stream

## UI Changes

### Visitor Page:
- ✅ Removed local video (visitor's camera)
- ✅ Shows only admin's video
- ✅ Changed button from "End Stream" to "Leave Stream"
- ✅ Updated messages to reflect one-way streaming
