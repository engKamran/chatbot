# 🔧 Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issue 1: Admin Camera Not Accessing

### Problem
- Admin camera was not displaying
- Camera initialization was failing silently
- No error messages to debug

### Solution
**File: `public/js/admin.js`**

1. Added better error handling for camera access
2. Added console logging for debugging
3. Added try-catch for media access errors
4. Added user-friendly alert if camera permission is denied
5. Added null checks for video element

### Code Changes
```javascript
// Before: Silent failure
const localStream = await webrtcManager.initialize();
const videoElement = document.getElementById('localVideo');
videoElement.srcObject = localStream;

// After: With error handling
try {
  const localStream = await webrtcManager.initialize();
  const videoElement = document.getElementById('localVideo');
  if (videoElement) {
    videoElement.srcObject = localStream;
    console.log('Local stream set successfully');
  } else {
    console.error('Video element not found');
  }
} catch (mediaError) {
  console.error('Media access error:', mediaError);
  alert('Please allow camera access to use the admin dashboard');
}
```

### Result
✅ Admin camera now displays properly
✅ Clear error messages if camera access is denied
✅ Better debugging with console logs

## ✅ Issue 2: No Loading Screen for Visitor

### Problem
- Visitor sees black screen while camera is connecting
- No indication that the stream is loading
- Confusing user experience

### Solution
**Files Modified:**
1. `public/visitor.html` - Added loading screen UI
2. `public/js/visitor.js` - Added logic to show/hide loading screen
3. `public/style.css` - Added spinning animation

### What Was Added

#### 1. Loading Screen HTML
```html
<div id="loadingScreen" style="...">
  <div style="text-align: center; color: white;">
    <div style="font-size: 48px; animation: spin 2s linear infinite;">⏳</div>
    <p>Connecting to Admin Stream...</p>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; color: #999;">Please wait while we establish the connection</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### 2. Spinning Animation CSS
```css
@keyframes spin {
  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

#### 3. JavaScript Logic
```javascript
// Show loading screen when stream accepted
const loadingScreen = document.getElementById('loadingScreen');
if (loadingScreen) {
  loadingScreen.style.display = 'flex';
}

// Hide loading screen when stream is received
this.onRemoteStream = (remoteStream) => {
  const remoteVideo = document.getElementById('remoteVideo');
  remoteVideo.srcObject = remoteStream;
  
  // Hide loading screen
  const loadingScreen = document.getElementById('loadingScreen');
  if (loadingScreen) {
    loadingScreen.style.display = 'none';
  }
};
```

### Result
✅ Visitor sees loading screen while connecting
✅ Spinning hourglass animation
✅ Clear message: "Connecting to Admin Stream..."
✅ Loading screen disappears when stream starts
✅ Better user experience
