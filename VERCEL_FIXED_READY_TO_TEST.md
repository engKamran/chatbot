## 🌐 Live URLs

### Admin Dashboard:
```
https://chatbot-mj5s.vercel.app/admin.html
```

### Visitor Page:
```
https://chatbot-mj5s.vercel.app/visitor.html
```

---

## 🚀 Test Now!

### Step 1: Open Both Pages
1. **Admin:** https://chatbot-mj5s.vercel.app/admin.html
2. **Visitor:** https://chatbot-mj5s.vercel.app/visitor.html

### Step 2: Check Connection Status
- ✅ Admin Status should show "Connected"
- ✅ Connection Status should show "Connected"
- ✅ No more disconnects

### Step 3: Test the Flow
1. Visitor enters name and joins queue
2. Admin sees visitor in queue
3. Admin clicks "Accept Visitor"
4. Visitor receives acceptance
5. Visitor watches admin's stream
6. Either can end stream

### Step 4: Verify It Works
- ✅ Admin receives visitor requests
- ✅ Connection stays stable
- ✅ No disconnects during stream
- ✅ Stream works smoothly

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Server-Side (server.js)
```javascript
// Added fallback transport
transports: ['websocket', 'polling']

// Added keep-alive pings
pingInterval: 25000
pingTimeout: 60000
```

### Client-Side (admin.js & visitor.js)
```javascript
// Added reconnection options
reconnection: true
reconnectionDelay: 1000
reconnectionDelayMax: 5000
reconnectionAttempts: 5

// Added fallback transport
transports: ['websocket', 'polling']
```

### Connection Handlers
- ✅ `connect` - Connected
- ✅ `disconnect` - Disconnected
- ✅ `connect_error` - Error
- ✅ `reconnect_attempt` - Reconnecting
- ✅ `reconnect` - Reconnected

---

## ✨ New Features

### Connection Status
- Real-time connection status
- Automatic reconnection
- Error messages
- Reconnection notifications

### Reliability
- WebSocket primary transport
- HTTP Polling fallback
- Automatic reconnection
- Keep-alive pings

### User Experience
- Clear status messages
- Error notifications
- Reconnection feedback
- Better error handling

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Connection Flow
1. Client connects to server
2. Server sends `connect` event
3. Client emits `admin-join` or `visitor-join`
4. Server broadcasts queue updates
5. Connection stays alive with pings
6. If disconnected, auto-reconnect

### Fallback Mechanism
- **Primary:** WebSocket (fast, real-time)
- **Fallback:** HTTP Polling (slower, but works everywhere)
- **Automatic:** Switches if WebSocket fails
